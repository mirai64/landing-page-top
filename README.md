# landing-page-top
This is Project: Landing Page from the Foundations Course on The Odin Project.

### so i know the project said not to peek at other people's projects... but i did.
#### i've been making short amounts of progress on this project for a couple of days but i think similar to what most people have done already, i've decided to model this after one of my characters, maru from amber of the stars. 

#### honestly i was kind of inspired by these:
https://criosyom.github.io/Hakurei_Shrine/
http://www.othercatt.com/

#### when i finish this and finish the section for amber of the stars, i'll probably add this to the character pages on NEO'S REALM
